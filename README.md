# Music Genre Classification

## Overview

This project focuses on classifying music tracks into different genres using machine learning techniques. The analysis involves processing audio data, extracting features, and training models to predict the genre of a given track.

## Key Features

- **Feature Extraction**: Extracting relevant audio features from music tracks such as MFCCs, chroma, and spectral contrast.
- **Model Training**: Using machine learning algorithms to classify music tracks into predefined genres.
- **Evaluation**: Assessing the model's performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and other relevant metrics.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Librosa**: For audio feature extraction.
- **Scikit-learn**: For building and evaluating machine learning models.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone 
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd repo-name
   ```
3. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:
   Open the `.ipynb` file using Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab to view and execute the code.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes various music tracks labeled with their respective genres. Feature extraction is performed on these tracks to create inputs for the machine learning model.

## Future Work

- Improve the model accuracy by experimenting with different algorithms and hyperparameters.
- Explore deep learning approaches for genre classification.
- Add more genres and a larger dataset for better generalization.
